falta traducci&oacute;n:

from the political philosopher david canadine (quoted by jeremy
paxman, a uk journalist).

i framed this, <a hal:attribute="href
{images.hate.details.src}.html">hate</a>, and <a hal:attribute="href
{images.thanks.details.src}.html">thank-you</a>, all printed slightly
smaller than normal, as a triptych in a dark frame.

one day i may re-work the image to include a lighter area as a
"reflection".
