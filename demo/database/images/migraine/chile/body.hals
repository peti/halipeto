falta traducci&oacute;n:

i gave this image, mounted on white in a honey-coloured box frame, as
a christmas present to my partner.

i had been working on the image in spare moments one weekend in la
serena.  to my tastes it was too complex and crowded, but pauli
noticed it on the screen and argued that it deserved to be kept.

printed and mounted, it looks surprisingly good - intense and vibrant.
