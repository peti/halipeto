these images are based on sketches i made of objects in my flat in la
serena, where i live while i'm working.

the keyring came from a museum in buenos aires. the yellow rectangle is
the back of my identification card (the large rectangular region
contains a very dense pattern of dots - a two dimensional barcode -
and the smaller ectangle contains my thumb print).
