falta traducci&oacute;n:

the images in this group are created by modelling the flow of light
through simple lenses.  two different lens morphologies are used -
linear and point (circular).

here the background has been quantised to give a "contour" effect and
inverted, with a modified gamma correction but without quantisation,
to provide the complementary "glow".
