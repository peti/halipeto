the sketches are scanned, producing a bitmap file.  potrace then
transforms this back into the lines that formed the original drawing.
from this (vector based) description an arbitrarily large image can be
generated without any pixel jaggies.

magnified images are montaged together using graphicsmagick and,
finally, the gimp is used to add a colour wash.
