i made this sitting while sitting outside, at the back of our house,
in the middle of a hot chilean summer.

again the image is generated using simple lens models.  in this case,
three layers are used: two are "ladders" of linear lenses, in
overlapping diagonal stripes; the third contains a few weaker,
circular lenses scattered across the field.

and, again, not for sale until i print a copy for myself.
